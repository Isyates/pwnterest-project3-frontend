    blurb: "Currently I am a medicinal cannabis consultant for Kush 21, where I work with our guests to provide as much education on the products we carry.  Prior to that, I was privileged to work for a development restaurant company, where I was exposed to world class hospitality and leadership development. They showed me what I had been missing, leadership skills, trust building, and they helped reinspire my own development towards being my best self. What I am aspiring to grow into is a team member of a company whoâ€™s goals mirror my own in that I seek to provide a service to better the lives of others through collaboration and innovation. ",
